# Strongs-Team-Profile-Generator

## Description

This is a team profile genetator, the user has selections of members of staff (Engineer, Intern and Manager) the user can enter information about the employee and will be populated on to an html file for easy viewing of all added team members.

The generator uses testing to ensure that all executabe code is running correctly, Constructor objects were used to create and hold the base data for all employees and aditional constructors were used to pass in all employee general information, and hold the specfific information about the type of employee (engineer, intern or manager).

This assignment really showed the complexity and importance of testing written code. The use of constructor functions is an excellent practice when working with and organizing data.

## Usage

Using node.js the user will input all revelant information about the specific employee and can add as many employees as desired. Once all prompts are answered, user will then be given the choice to add additional employees or choose to deny any new employees. Once the user has completed building the team the team will be automatically be generated to an html page with all input that the user has entered for viewing.
